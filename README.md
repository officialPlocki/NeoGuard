## Disclaimer ⚠️

NeoGuard strives for data security excellence, but in the ever-changing realm of tech, no one has all the answers. We've got your back, but remember, tech is like a box of chocolates – you never know what you're gonna get.

While NeoGuard's magic enhances security, no spell is unbreakable. If a chink in the armor is found, our wizards will conjure a fix. But remember, every adventure has its twists!

By using NeoGuard, you acknowledge that security is a journey, not a destination. NeoGuard, its creators, and sorcerers can't be held responsible for unexpected bumps in the road.
